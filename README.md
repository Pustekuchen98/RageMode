[SIZE=5][B]Gameplay:[/B][/SIZE]
RageMode is a Call of Duty inspired game.
You start and respawn with a bow that shoots explosives arrows, a knife for awesome knife fights and for trolling your friend with a backstab and with the combat-axe, which you can throw. You have also a compass in the last inventory slot to see where is the nearest player.
You can play with as many people as you want. And after some minutes, which you can also decide, the game ends. At the end, the player with the most points win.
